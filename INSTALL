cd NFSping
make
sudo make install

NFSping requires gmake. It uses some gcc-isms that may mean it won't compile with other C compilers but that hasn't been tested.
Manpages are built with ronn (http://rtomayko.github.io/ronn/).
RPC code is generated with rpcgen.
At the moment it doesn't compile on FreeBSD because of conflicts with the portmap header files that it generates and the builtin ones shipped with FreeBSD.
The Makefile links the realtime library (-lrt) to pull in clock_gettime(). This is included in libc in glibc > 2.17 but there's no code to check yet and I'm trying to avoid autotools.
